## Usage

From the homepage, you can click on 'Leaderboard' to see which players have the most wins, 'Login/Sign Up' to create or access your own profile, and 'Play Game' to be taken to the game page. JEB-Jack plays much like classic blackjack: you are dealt 2 cards to start and can see one of the dealer's cards, you can click 'Hit' to draw a card or 'Stand' when you're ready to proceed with the cards you have, and the goal is to have a higher score than the dealer without going over 21. JEB-Jack however uses more than just the standard 52 playing cards: there are UNO number cards and Mahjong tiles to add visual variety to the regular number cards, tarot cards to 'trump' your current hand and overwrite it's score with the number on the card, and power up cards with all kinds of special effects to shake up the game.

## Special Cards

UNO - Numbered cards give respective values to players hand. The skip card skips the dealers turn making them unable to draw any more cards, the revserse cards switch your hand with the dealers, and the plus two cards make the dealer draw two.

Tarot - If you draw a tarot card that cards value is now the value of your hand and you can no longer draw, if you have two tarot cards it will use the higher valued one

Majong - The number of pin on the tile are the value added to your hand

Charizard - Gets rid of (burns) dealers cards

Black Lotus - Gives the player 1-3 depending on what will be most useful to them

Dark Magician - Switch one of your cards with the dealers of your choosing

Babe Ruth - Get rid of one of yours or the dealers cards

Abomb - Reset the game

Get Out of Jail Free - Removes last drawn card
