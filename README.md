## Description

Welcome to JEB-Jack! Nearly everyone has played or at least heard of blackjack but JEB-Jack shakes up the classic to add a little chaos for extra fun. Iconic cards from other games have been added both for visual variety and to add new mechanics to the game.

## Installation

Simply visit the site [here](https://jeb-jack.onrender.com/).

## Usage

From the homepage, you can click on 'Leaderboard' to see which players have the most wins, 'Login/Sign Up' to create or access your own profile, and 'Play Game' to be taken to the game page. JEB-Jack plays much like classic blackjack: you are dealt 2 cards to start and can see one of the dealer's cards, you can click 'Hit' to draw a card or 'Stand' when you're ready to proceed with the cards you have, and the goal is to have a higher score than the dealer without going over 21. JEB-Jack however uses more than just the standard 52 playing cards: there are UNO number cards and Mahjong tiles to add visual variety to the regular number cards, tarot cards to 'trump' your current hand and overwrite it's score with the number on the card, and power up cards with all kinds of special effects to shake up the game.
